# DeepTruth - Unmasking the Unreal  

## 📝 Description 
DeepTruth is a deep learning-based framework designed to **detect and differentiate real human faces from AI-generated fakes**.  
With the rise of **DeepFakes** and synthetic media, the ability to distinguish real from fake has become crucial in fighting misinformation, identity fraud, and digital manipulation.  

DeepTruth leverages **state-of-the-art deep learning models** trained on diverse datasets containing both **real and synthetic faces** to create a highly accurate and robust detection system.

##  🗂️ Data Sources  
DeepTruth is trained and evaluated on a combination of **real and synthetic face datasets** to ensure robust performance.  

### **Real Face Datasets:**  
- **CelebA (CelebFaces Attributes Dataset)**  
  - Contains over **200,000 celebrity images** with **40 attribute annotations**.  

- **FFHQ (Flickr-Faces-HQ)**  
  - A high-quality dataset containing **70,000 PNG images** at **1024×1024 resolution**.  
  

- **Human Faces (Kaggle)**  
  - A collection of **real human face images**.  

### **Synthetic (AI-Generated) Face Datasets:**  
- **DeepFake Face Detection Dataset (Kaggle)**  
  - A dataset containing **DeepFake-generated images** for fake face recognition.  
  
- **StyleGAN3 Generated Images**  
  - Custom **synthetic face images generated using StyleGAN3**.  

- **Generated Faces from Online Sources**  
  - Additional AI-generated face images sourced from:  ThisPersonDoesNotExist  

## ⭐️ Features

- **Excellent Generalization** across unseen DeepFake types and datasets  
  - No fully pre-trained deep learning model was used  
  - Instead, a partially pre-trained CNN was customized: **some layers were frozen**, while others were fine-tuned to suit the task  
- **Deep Learning Model** (CNN based)  
- Trained on Large-Scale Real & Synthetic Face Datasets 
- Image input size to the models = **512 x 512** 
- Supports **Image DeepFake Detection**  
- Achieves **High Accuracy** in Detecting AI-Generated Faces  
- Compatible with Multiple DeepFake Generators *(StyleGAN, FaceSwap, etc.)*  
- **Open-Source** & Extendable for Future Research  


## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository or download the raw files:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikipatil281/Deepfake-Image-Detection.git
cd Deepfake-Image-Detection
```

(Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ⚙️ Usage

### 🔧 Training the Model

To train the model from scratch:
- Open and run the Jupyter notebook: `notebooks/train_model.ipynb`
- Make sure the dataset paths are correctly set inside the notebook.
- Make sure the `DESIRED PATH TO MODEL` is replaced with the actual path the trained model should be saved
- You’ll see training progress, accuracy score and losses.
- The trained model will be saved automatically (as a `.pth` file).

### 🧪 Testing with Pretrained Model

To test our pretrained model:
- Load the notebook: `notebooks/Predict_real_or_fake.ipynb`
- Upload an image file (real or fake) by providing the path of the image in the notebook - Where ever `PATH TO INPUT IMAGE` is mentioned, add the image path
- Make sure the model path (`model/1.8L_deepfake_detector.pth`) is correctly set inside the notebook.
- The notebook will load the saved model and display whether the image is real or fake.
